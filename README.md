# Entity Relationship Model
Before beginning this project, I researched the data models necessary to construct the desired application. This research included defining the entities and the relationships between them, creating a comprehensive list of fields and data points, and outlining the necessary actions for the application to function correctly. With this information in hand, I was able to construct the necessary models for the project and ensure that the application would be able to meet its goals.
