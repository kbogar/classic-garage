# Entity Relationship Model
Before beginning this project, I researched the data models necessary to construct the desired application. This research included defining the entities and the relationships between them, creating a comprehensive list of fields and data points, and outlining the necessary actions for the application to function correctly. With this information in hand, I was able to construct the necessary models for the project and ensure that the application would be able to meet its goals.

## Issues
![](/documentation/issues.png)
I found the Agile Methodology to be an extremely useful tool for organizing and managing the development of my project. By breaking down the project into smaller tasks, I was able to better track my progress and ensure that I stayed on schedule. Additionally, I was able to make adjustments to my plan as needed, allowing me to make the most of my time and resources. The satisfaction of ticking off a completed User Story and placing it in the 'Done' column was also a great motivator.
